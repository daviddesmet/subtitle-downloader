# SubDB Subtitle Downloader

A no hassle subtitle downloader console app for SubDB.

[SubDB](http://thesubdb.com/) is a free, centralized subtitle database intended to be used only by opensource and non-commercial softwares.

## Usage

Just drag & drop the movie file on top of the executable to download a subtitle. Yup, that easy ;)
Or if you prefer, execute the app and follow on-screen instructions.

### Compiling from source?

Execute the commands below to compile the source code and execute the app.

```bash
dotnet restore
```

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Is there a nicer UI Version?

An alternative version using Avalonia UI was developed. It will be released once drag and drop gets fixed in v0.10.

## Special Thanks

Cheers to the amazing team behind [SubDB](http://thesubdb.com/).
